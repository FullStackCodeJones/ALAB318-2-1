Express App: Mystical Routes & Downloads ✨🌿
Welcome to my Express app! 🪄 It’s a little like mixing tech and hoodoo—there’s magic happening behind the scenes. 🌙 This app covers routing, middleware, serving files, and all the good stuff that makes Express feel like a spell that works every time. 🔮

What’s Inside 🔮
Logging Middleware: 📝 Tracks all requests like a good ancestor keeping notes.
Morgan Middleware: 📜 Gives you all the details with "dev" logging format. It's like reading the signs from the universe but for requests.
Static Files: 🖼️ I’ve included some pics (including a special hoodoo image) that you can view and enjoy.
Downloadable Files: 📥 Ever wanted to just download a magical photo with a click? Well, now you can. 😎
Form Handling: 📝 I’ve got a form that lets you submit your name, and you’ll get to see it logged in the console! Just don’t try to use it to sign anything legally binding... 🙃
Dynamic Routes: 🚀 If you want to get all mystical and input a user ID, just try /user/:id and watch the magic unfold.
How to Use 🧙‍♀️
Clone or download this repo.
Run npm install to set up your dependencies.
Start the server with npm start (like lighting a candle to start the ritual ✨).
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to get started!
Fill out the form with your name, submit it, and see the console magic. 💻✨
Hit the Download button to grab the hoodoo image (or any file you choose to bless!). 📸
What I Learned 🌱
This project was about learning the magic of Express, and seeing how the pieces of middleware, routes, and static files come together. It’s like setting up an altar for your code—everything has its purpose, and when it all works, it feels like a blessing. 🙌
